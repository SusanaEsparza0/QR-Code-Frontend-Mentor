Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This practice was fun, I used it to get away from what I always do at work. It was useful to try to summarise the code a bit more than creating a box within a box and increase the cascade. 

This challenge helped me to get used to not increasing code unnecessarily and how to centre a container in an easier way.  

### Continued development

Within this project, I went back to using GitHub after half a year and it helped me to get used to how to use it again. I would like to concentrate more on the CSS properties as there are some that I didn't know about and they helped me to solve this exercise. 


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This page helped me to understand how to centre the container. I like how they allow you to modify the code to understand how it works.

## Acknowledgments

It helped me a lot to know the basics of programming, so I was able to solve the exercise faster than I would have been able to if I didn't know at least some HTML and CSS.
